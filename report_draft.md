**Main Thesis:**  
In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," the tension between idealism and the harsh realities of corruption and inequality is poignantly illustrated through the rise and fall of a utopian vision for the farm, which devolves into a tyrannical regime. As the initially noble ideals of Animalism, founded on the principles of equality and shared prosperity, begin to erode under the pressures of power and ambition, Orwell deftly reveals how the seductive nature of authority corrupts those in positions of leadership and ultimately undermines the very ideals that revolution aimed to establish. The gradual transformation of the pigs from comrades to oppressors serves as a chilling reminder of how, in pursuit of an ideal, the reality of human (or animal) nature — greed, fear, and indifference — can thwart the noblest intentions and perpetuate cycles of oppression.

**Point 1:**  
Orwell employs the character of Napoleon, whose Machiavellian ascent to power illustrates how idealistic movements can become corrupted by self-interest and ambition, leading to unequal distributions of power and privilege. Napoleon's rise is marked by his cunning tactics, including the expulsion of Snowball, which he justifies by claiming that Snowball is a traitor. As he declares, "Comrades, do you know who is responsible for this? It was that villain Snowball!" This manipulation of information serves to consolidate his power while simultaneously stifling dissent. By presenting Snowball as a scapegoat, Napoleon fosters blind loyalty among the other animals, allowing him to maintain control over their minds and actions. The analysis of this moment reveals how a leader's ambition can corrupt a collective ideal, leading to a hierarchy that mirrors the oppression the animals sought to escape. The initial promise of equality becomes overshadowed by Napoleon's greed, emphasizing the theme that when power is accumulated in the hands of a few, it invariably leads to the exploitation of the many.

**Point 2:**  
The deterioration of the Seven Commandments into a single, ambiguous decree highlights the malleability of language and law, suggesting that those in power manipulate ideals to serve their own ends while further entrenching inequality among the animals. Initially, the commandments provide a foundation for Animalism, embodying the principles of equality and justice. However, as the pigs begin to deviate from these ideals, they rewrite the commandments to suit their needs, culminating in the simplification to "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." This alteration is a stark symbol of how language can be twisted to convey false truths, allowing those in power to justify their actions. The analysis of this transformation illustrates the ease with which leaders can exploit language to erode the foundational principles of a movement. It serves as a warning that the very tools intended to foster fairness can be weaponized to perpetuate inequality, reflecting Orwell's critique of totalitarian regimes that manipulate ideological language for their gain.

**Point 3:**  
Through the character of Boxer, whose unwavering loyalty and tragic fate underscore the disillusionment experienced by those who believe in the idealistic vision of Animalism; his demise reflects the exploitation of the working class and the betrayal of revolutionary ideals by the ruling elite. Boxer embodies the spirit of hard work and dedication, famously declaring, "I will work harder," and "Napoleon is always right." However, despite his immense contributions to the farm, he is ultimately sold to the glue factory when he can no longer serve a purpose, revealing the cruelty of those in power towards the very individuals who uphold their regime. This betrayal illustrates the harsh reality that the leaders, who once promised equality, are prepared to sacrifice their loyal followers for profit and self-preservation. The analysis of Boxer’s fate highlights the tragic consequences of misplaced trust in a corrupt system, where the working class is exploited rather than celebrated. Boxer’s heartbreaking end serves as a poignant reminder of the need for vigilance and critical thought in any society claiming to champion equality.

**Conclusion:**  
In "Animal Farm," Orwell masterfully navigates the complex interplay between idealism and the grim realities of corruption and inequality, ultimately providing a cautionary tale about the fragility of noble aspirations in the face of power dynamics that invariably seek to subvert them. The allegorical representation of the rise and fall of the animals' ideals serves not only as a critique of totalitarian regimes but also as a universal warning against the potential decay of ethical principles in the relentless pursuit of power. Through this lens, the novel compels readers to be vigilant of the forces that threaten to undermine equality and justice within any societal structure. The struggles experienced by the animals, particularly through Napoleon's corruption, the manipulation of laws, and Boxer's exploitation, illustrate the imperative to remain committed to the principles of fairness and collective effort, lest history repeat itself in the guise of new forms of oppression.
