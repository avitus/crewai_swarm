**Main Thesis:** In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," the author poignantly illustrates the tension between idealism and the harsh realities of corruption and inequality through the evolution of the farm's governance, examining how revolutionary ideals—rooted in equality and freedom—are systematically undermined by the rise of a tyrannical regime. Orwell demonstrates that the noble aspirations for a just society can easily be corrupted by authoritarianism and the inherent inequality of power dynamics, highlighting the inevitable cycle of oppression that ensues when the ruling class prioritizes its own interests above the collective good. This tension between the original revolutionary ideals and their perverse transformation provides a critical commentary on the trajectory of political movements, where the quest for equality can ultimately give way to the very inequalities it seeks to eradicate.

**Point 1:** The initial ideals of Animalism, representing the profound hopes of the revolutionaries for a society built on equality, ultimately devolve into a stark authoritarianism, illustrating how noble intentions can be compromised by ambition and greed. In the early pages of "Animal Farm," the animals proclaim their dream of a farm free from human oppression, encapsulated in the motto, "All animals are equal." This statement embodies the essence of their revolutionary zeal, suggesting a fundamental commitment to fairness and shared prosperity. However, as the pigs gradually usurp power, the revolutionary ethos transforms. Orwell notes, “The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.” This chilling observation reflects the complete erosion of the original ideals, demonstrating how the desire for dominance can distort even the most sincere ambitions. The decline from egalitarian hopes to oppressive reality elucidates the theme that unrestrained ambition can corrupt the purest intentions.

**Point 2:** Through the gradual erosion of the Seven Commandments and their eventual transformation into self-serving principles by the pigs, Orwell vividly depicts the mechanisms of corruption that exploit and manipulate the very ideals that inspired the uprising. The Seven Commandments initially serve as the foundational tenets for the animals' society, ensuring their unity in the pursuit of Animalism. However, as the pigs consolidate their power, these commandments begin to change: “No animal shall drink alcohol” becomes “No animal shall drink alcohol to excess,” reflecting a drastic shift towards accommodating the pigs’ vices. This subtle change illustrates a profound betrayal of the revolution’s ethical framework, showcasing how language can be manipulated to justify corruption. Later, the commandment “All animals are equal” eventually morphs into “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,” rendering the principle of equality meaningless. This transformation serves as a powerful commentary on the malleability of ideology in the hands of corrupt leaders, who prioritize their interests over the collective good and highlight the systemic fragility of idealistic values in the face of opportunism.

**Point 3:** The contrasting experiences of the animals—particularly the disenfranchisement of the working class and the privileges enjoyed by the ruling pigs—serve to underscore the endemic inequality that arises not merely from external factors but also from the betrayal of revolutionary values by those in power. The hardworking horse, Boxer, epitomizes the plight of the laboring class, tirelessly working for the supposed benefit of all while receiving little in return. Despite his unwavering loyalty and work ethic, he is ultimately sold to the knacker when he is no longer useful, illustrating the betrayal of the working class by the elite. Orwell writes, “I will work harder,” represents Boxer’s unyielding faith in the revolution, yet his demise reveals the tragic irony that his dedication fuels the very system that exploits him. In stark contrast, the pigs indulge in luxuries, living in the farmhouse and enjoying privileges that starkly differentiate them from the other animals. This juxtaposition reveals that the revolution has not eliminated inequality, but rather replaced one form of oppression with another. Through these experiences, Orwell poignantly highlights how the betrayal of revolutionary ideals leads to a society where exploitation and inequality thrive under the guise of a new order.

**Conclusion:** Ultimately, "Animal Farm" serves as a cautionary tale about the fragility of idealism in the face of corruption and inequality; Orwell’s narrative illustrates that without vigilance and accountability, even the most righteous movements can be co-opted, resulting in a society that mirrors the very injustices it sought to abolish. The degradation of Animalism from an inspiring vision into a tool for tyranny epitomizes the risks inherent in political upheavals, where the dynamics of power can overshadow ideological commitments. Through this allegory, readers are compelled to recognize the complexities of political power and the essential need for critical self-reflection and resistance to tyranny. The stark portrayal of compromised ideals urges us to remain ever-watchful against the encroachment of authoritarianism, reinforcing the timeless lesson that the struggle for justice must be an ongoing endeavor, constantly evaluated and safeguarded against the allure of power and the desensitization to inequality.
